Run the Development Server:
Start the development server to run the React application locally. This will start the app and typically open it in your default web browser.

Deploy the Application:
You can deploy the built application to any static site hosting service like GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel. If you're using GitHub Pages, you might have a script to deploy:
# Using npm
npm run deploy

# Using yarn
yarn deploy
